# CryptingKeyStore
 
## Usage
CryptingKeyStore can be used to store crypting keys behind a password, for example if you want to crypt usb stick's content and decrypt them with a long key that you can access with a password.

## Installation
Note for Windows users: You can compile main.cpp for yourshelf if .exe does not work.
For windows download .exe file
For linux (and MacOs) download .out file

## How to use it
First crypt files and mark down the key
Then run .out or .exe file and anwser questions

QUESTIONS:
1. Enter the crypt key
2. Enter the password
3. Enter message to be displayed when opening generated file(more about file generaing later)

After you have anwseres questions, compile Program.cpp and now you have .exe or .out file that you can use to access the key via password
Note: delete all files except compiled Program.cpp for security reasons
